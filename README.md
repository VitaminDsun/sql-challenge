homework 9
to start this assignment i was asked to creat a -ERD- (Entity Relationship Diagram) this created the tables I will be useing in pgadmin, and this also allowed me to create the columns and establish primary keys foreign keys or (PK's and FK's) this allowed to connections from each of these tables. Once this is done the ERD can be exported to pgadmin and used with databases, there I was asked to list certin detail from the tables after imputing some CSV's such as first name, last name, hire date for certain dates, departments, and other employee information.
